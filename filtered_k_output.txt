Filtered kNovelty Experiment
============================

Decomposes kNovelty(H=3) clusters by schema class:
  Trivial:  X->X, X*X, X+X, SelfId(X)
  Susp:     Susp(...)
  RevArrow: X->L (free mapping space)
  Const:    involves 1 or 0 (e.g. 1+X)
  Core:     pure L/X schemas (should match proof-rank)

--- Part 4: X->L inclusion test ---

If X->L (free mapping space) is a genuine core schema:
  core' = core + rev
  Then nu_grammar = core', nu_homotopy = susp_chains
  And nu = core' + susp should match nu_paper

--- Part 5: What bonus formula makes core+bonus = ν_paper? ---
