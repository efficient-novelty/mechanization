% ABSTRACT
% ============================================
\begin{abstract}
General Relativity fails at $t = 0$, yielding nonsensical infinite values at the initial singularity.
Physics currently lacks a mathematical vocabulary for a universe assembling its own rules.
We demonstrate that the initial singularity is not a point of infinite mass-energy density in pre-existing spacetime, but the exact computational phase transition where external metamathematical assembly (algorithmic time, $\tau$) is compiled into internal geometric dynamics (physical time, $t$).
By applying the Kinematic-Dynamic Equivalence ($\nextmod X \simeq X^{\D}$) of the Dynamical Cohesive Topos at Step~15 of the PEN Generative Sequence~\cite{pen}, we show that the Big Bang represents the ignition of autonomous guarded corecursion.
This algorithmic origin naturally derives the thermodynamic arrow of time, the minimal-entropy initial state, and provides a strict type-theoretic mechanism for cosmic inflation.
The Univalent Horizon---the structural boundary at which the sequence permanently halts---is identified as the cosmological firewall separating the pre-physical compilation epoch from the self-computing physical universe.

% 1. INTRODUCTION
% ============================================
\section{Introduction: Cosmogenesis as a Logical Phase Transition}
\label{sec:introduction}

\subsection{The First-Cause Paradox and Its Dissolution}

Standard cosmological models treat time as a pre-existing real line $\R$ upon which a singularity is placed at $t = 0$.
The singularity is then a pathology: a point where curvature scalars diverge, geodesics are incomplete, and the field equations cease to predict~\cite{hawking-ellis}.
This framing converts an explanatory failure into an ontological posit---the universe ``began'' in a state that the theory's own mathematics cannot describe.

The difficulty is structural, not technical.
Any framework that presupposes a continuous time manifold and then asks what happened at its boundary is asking the container to explain its own origin.
The question ``what caused the Big Bang?'' inherits the full weight of the first-cause paradox: every causal explanation requires a prior temporal context, generating an infinite regress or an unexplained brute fact.

PEN dissolves this paradox by rejecting the premise.
Time is not an ambient container in which events are arranged; it is a data structure that had to be algorithmically constructed and selected for efficiency~\cite{pen}.
The Generative Sequence builds spatial topology, cohesion, differential structure, metrics, and functional-analytic machinery across 14~discrete steps \emph{before} temporal dynamics exists.
Physical time---continuous, geometric, directional---arrives at Step~15 as the output of the Kinematic-Dynamic Equivalence ($\nextmod X \simeq X^{\D}$), not as a background assumption.

\subsection{Compiler vs.\ Runtime}
\label{sec:compiler-runtime}

The conceptual structure of PEN's cosmogenesis maps precisely onto the distinction between compilation and execution in computation theory.

\begin{definition}[Compilation Epoch]
\label{def:compilation}
The \emph{compilation epoch} (Steps~1--14) is the discrete metamathematical assembly of the kinematic framework.
During this epoch, the library $\B_n$ grows monotonically under the selection dynamics (Axioms~1--5 of~\cite{pen}), accumulating type formers, higher-inductive types, modal operators, and axiomatic extensions.
No continuous internal observers, trajectories, or dynamical equations exist.
Time is measured solely by algorithmic ticks $\tau_n$ and integration latency $\Delta_n = F_n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Runtime Ignition]
\label{def:ignition}
\emph{Runtime ignition} (Step~15) is the realization of the Dynamical Cohesive Topos (DCT), which introduces temporal modalities ($\nextmod$, $\eventually$), infinitesimals ($\D$), and the Compatibility Triad into the library.
At this step, the universe transitions from extrinsic structural selection (maximizing $\rho$) to intrinsic dynamical evolution (integrating vector fields on $\U$).
\end{definition}

The Big Bang, on this account, is neither a physical explosion nor a mathematical singularity.
It is the exact moment at which a self-assembling formal system becomes causally closed and begins computing its own future.


% ============================================
% 2. THE PRE-PHYSICAL EPOCH
% ============================================
\section{The Pre-Physical Epoch: Algorithmic Time ($\tau$)}
\label{sec:pre-physical}

\subsection{Assembly of the Phase Space}
\label{sec:assembly}

Prior to Step~15, the library $\B_{14}$ contains the full spatial and functional-analytic infrastructure of modern physics: dependent types, higher-inductive types ($S^1, S^2, S^3$), cohesion ($\flat, \sharp, \Disc, \Pi_{\mathrm{coh}}$), connections, curvature, metrics, frame bundles, and Hilbert functionals~\cite{pen}.
These structures exist as a static, well-typed formal library---a univalent 0-groupoid sequence of realized specifications.
They describe \emph{what kinds of spaces and operations are available}, not \emph{how anything moves within them}.

The distinction is categorical: $\B_{14}$ is a kinematic library, not a dynamical system.
It contains the type $S^3$ but no trajectory on $S^3$; it contains the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ but no Einstein equation governing its evolution; it contains Hilbert spaces but no Schr\"odinger equation propagating states through them.
The library is a phase space without a Hamiltonian---a stage fully constructed but with no actors yet in motion.

\subsection{The Two Clocks}
\label{sec:two-clocks}

A persistent conceptual error in cosmological thinking is the implicit assumption that ``before the Big Bang'' must refer to a prior interval of physical time.
PEN makes the temporal structure fully explicit by distinguishing two incommensurable notions of time.

\begin{definition}[Algorithmic Time]
\label{def:alg-time}
\emph{Algorithmic time} $\tau$ is the discrete tick counter of the Generative Sequence.
At each tick $\tau_n$, the selection dynamics evaluates candidates against the bar $\mathrm{Bar}_n = \Phi_n \cdot \Omega_{n-1}$, realizes the minimal-overshoot winner, and increments the library.
The elapsed algorithmic time at step $n$ is $\tau_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \Delta_i$, where $\Delta_i = F_i$ is the Fibonacci integration latency.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Physical Time]
\label{def:phys-time}
\emph{Physical time} $t$ is the continuous geometric parameter arising from the Kinematic-Dynamic Equivalence (Lemma~5.10 of~\cite{pen}):
\begin{equation}
    \nextmod X \;\simeq\; X^{\D}.
\end{equation}
Physical time exists only after Step~15, when the ``next'' modality $\nextmod$ is identified with the tangent endofunctor $(-)^{\D}$, converting discrete temporal succession into continuous infinitesimal displacement.
\end{definition}

The two clocks have entirely different character.
Algorithmic time is discrete, external to the library, and measured in structural ticks.
Physical time is continuous, internal to the DCT, and measured in infinitesimal tangent displacements.
There is no meaningful sense in which $\tau_{14}$ is ``earlier than'' $t = 0$; the two quantities inhabit different ontological categories, related only by the phase transition at Step~15 that converts one into the other.

\begin{remark}[Why ``before the Big Bang'' is a category error]
\label{rem:category-error}
Asking ``what happened before the Big Bang'' presupposes that physical time extends to the left of $t = 0$.
In PEN, the pre-Step~15 epoch is not a prior interval of $t$ but a structurally distinct generative process indexed by $\tau$.
The question dissolves: nothing happened \emph{before} $t = 0$ in physical time, because physical time does not exist before Step~15.
What happened \emph{instead} of physical time was algorithmic assembly---a categorically different process that produced the conditions under which physical time could exist at all.
\end{remark}

% 3. STEP 15 IGNITION
% ============================================
\section{Step~15 Ignition: The Birth of Physical Time ($t = 0$)}
\label{sec:ignition}

\subsection{The Arrival of LTL}
\label{sec:ltl}

The Dynamical Cohesive Topos extends the library $\B_{14}$ with three structural components (Definition~5.7 of~\cite{pen}):

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*), nosep]
    \item \textbf{Temporal Logic:} The modalities $\nextmod$ (``next'') and $\eventually$ (``eventually'') from Linear Temporal Logic, following Nakano~\cite{nakano}.
    \item \textbf{Infinitesimals:} A type $\D$ with $0 : \D$ and $d^2 = 0$ for all $d : \D$.
    \item \textbf{Compatibility Triad:}
    (C1)~$\nextmod(\flat X) \simeq \flat(\nextmod X)$;
    (C2)~$\nextmod(\Pi X) \simeq \Pi(\nextmod X)$;
    (C3)~$\nextmod(X^{\D}) \simeq (\nextmod X)^{\D}$.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The specification cost is $\kappa = 8$ (2~imports + 2~temporal + 1~infinitesimal + 3~compatibility clauses).
The generative capacity is $\nu = 103$, yielding $\rho = 12.88$, which clears the Step~15 bar of $7.40$ by the largest margin in the sequence~\cite{pen}.

\subsection{The Kinematic-Dynamic Equivalence as Geometrization of Time}
\label{sec:kde}

The central mechanism is the Kinematic-Dynamic Equivalence (Lemma~5.10 of~\cite{pen}): the Compatibility Triad forces the discrete temporal modality $\nextmod$ to be natively equivalent to the continuous tangent endofunctor $(-)^{\D}$.

This is not a stipulation but a \emph{forced identification}.
The three compatibility axioms (C1)--(C3) constrain $\nextmod$ so severely that it can only be consistently interpreted as tangent exponentiation.
The proof proceeds by functorial substitution: replacing $\nextmod X$ with $X^{\D}$ throughout the triad yields identities that hold by the structural properties of flat, shape, and infinitesimal modalities already present in $\B_{14}$~\cite{pen}.

The physical content of this equivalence is profound: \emph{the passage of time is the same operation as infinitesimal spatial displacement}.
What the temporal logic calls ``the next state'' is what synthetic differential geometry calls ``an infinitesimal tangent vector.''
This identification establishes $t = 0$---not as a point on a pre-existing timeline, but as the moment at which the concept of temporal succession acquires geometric content.

\subsection{The Guarded Corecursion Engine}
\label{sec:corecursion}

The temporal logic of Nakano~\cite{nakano} carries a powerful recursion principle: L\"ob's guarded fixpoint rule,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lob}
    \fix : (\nextmod A \to A) \to A.
\end{equation}
This rule states: given a function that can produce an $A$ provided it has access to ``tomorrow's'' $A$, one can construct a definite $A$ today.
The guardedness condition (the $\nextmod$ on the left of the arrow) prevents circular self-reference by ensuring that present computation may depend on future values only through the temporal delay.

Applied to the DCT's kinematic library, L\"ob's rule has the following operational effect.
A discrete-time dynamical system is a map $f : X \to \nextmod X$---given a current state, compute the next state.
Under the Kinematic-Dynamic Equivalence, this becomes:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vf}
    f : X \to X^{\D},
\end{equation}
which is precisely a \emph{vector field} in synthetic differential geometry: a section of the tangent bundle assigning an infinitesimal displacement to each point.
The guarded corecursion principle then unfolds any such vector field into a global trajectory:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:unfold}
    \unfold_f : X \;\to\; \Stream\, X.
\end{equation}
This is the cosmological spark.
The 14~static structures of $\B_{14}$ are the fuel; $\nextmod$ is the ignition mechanism; L\"ob's rule is the engine that converts a local infinitesimal prescription into perpetual, autonomous motion.
Before Step~15, the library describes spaces.
After Step~15, the library computes trajectories through those spaces.

\begin{proposition}[Step~15 as the onset of dynamics]
\label{prop:onset}
Prior to the realization of the DCT, no structure in $\B_{14}$ can express temporal evolution: there is no type former producing streams, no fixpoint principle, and no identification of succession with tangent displacement.
The DCT is the \emph{unique minimal} extension of $\B_{14}$ that introduces autonomous dynamics, and it does so with $\kappa = 8$ clauses.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Dynamics requires (i)~a notion of succession, (ii)~a fixpoint or corecursion principle to unfold finite prescriptions into infinite trajectories, and (iii)~compatibility with the existing geometric library so that trajectories inhabit the already-constructed spaces.
Requirements (i) and (ii) are supplied by $\nextmod$ and L\"ob's rule; requirement~(iii) is enforced by the Compatibility Triad.
No proper subset of these eight clauses suffices: removing any temporal modality eliminates succession; removing $\D$ eliminates the geometric interpretation; removing any compatibility axiom breaks the forced identification $\nextmod X \simeq X^{\D}$.
\end{proof}


% ============================================
% 4. COSMIC INFLATION
% ============================================
\section{Cosmological Inflation as Combinatorial Schema Synthesis}
\label{sec:inflation}

\subsection{The $\rho = 12.88$ Efficiency Singularity}
\label{sec:rho-spike}

The efficiency ratio at Step~15 is $\rho = 103/8 = 12.88$, exceeding the bar ($7.40$) by a factor of $1.74$---the largest overshoot in the entire 15-step sequence~\cite{pen}.
This ``efficiency singularity'' is the PEN counterpart of the cosmological singularity, but with a crucial difference: the mathematics does not break down.
Where General Relativity produces divergent curvature scalars at $t = 0$, PEN produces a finite, well-defined maximum of algorithmic efficiency.
The singularity is not a failure of the formalism but a signature of \emph{optimal synthesis}---the point at which the library's combinatorial capacity is most powerfully leveraged.

\begin{remark}[Efficiency singularity vs.\ curvature singularity]
\label{rem:singularity-contrast}
In GR, the initial singularity signals the breakdown of the theory: physical quantities (density, temperature, curvature) diverge, and the Einstein equations lose predictive power~\cite{hawking-ellis,wald}.
In PEN, the ``singularity'' at Step~15 is a computable finite maximum of a well-defined ratio.
It arises not from a failure of description but from the confluence of three structural amplifiers---the Distributive Law, Universe Polymorphism, and Infinitesimal Dimension Shift---which collectively multiply the base novelty of 6~axiom rules into $\nu = 103$~\cite{pen}.
The analogy is precise: both mark the moment of cosmological origin.
The disanalogy is equally precise: one is a breakdown, the other is a peak of algorithmic performance.
\end{remark}

\subsection{The $\nu = 103$ Explosion and the Inflationary Epoch}
\label{sec:nu-explosion}

Cosmic inflation is the hypothesis that the very early universe underwent a brief period of exponentially rapid expansion, during which the number of accessible physical degrees of freedom increased by many orders of magnitude~\cite{guth,linde}.
In PEN, the analogous phenomenon is the combinatorial schema explosion at Step~15.

The mechanism is the Combinatorial Schema Synthesis theorem (Theorem~5.6 of~\cite{pen}): when the DCT's temporal modalities ($\nextmod$, $\eventually$) are introduced into a library of 14~structures already equipped with spatial modalities ($\flat, \sharp, \Disc, \Pi_{\mathrm{coh}}$), the cross-interaction at depth~2 produces a superlinear explosion of new inference schemas.
Concretely:

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item The \textbf{Distributive Law} detector identifies Beck-type distributive laws between the new temporal modalities and existing spatial modalities, contributing $+38$ to $\nu_C$.
    The 14~previously isolated kinematic structures suddenly acquire mutual temporal-spatial interaction terms.
    \item \textbf{Universe Polymorphism} recognizes that L\"ob-type eliminators are polymorphic over all 14~library types, contributing $+42$ to $\nu_C$.
    Every type in the library gains a temporal dynamics.
    \item The \textbf{Infinitesimal Dimension Shift} forces new Kan operations on each library HIT, contributing $\nu_H = 15$.
    Tangent structure generates new homotopical content at every sphere.
\end{itemize}

The picture is one of sudden, explosive logical cross-interaction: 14~structures that previously coexisted as independent library entries are now woven into a single dynamical fabric, with each pair generating new eliminators, new homotopy schemas, and new compositional types.
This is the algorithmic analogue of inflationary reheating: the degrees of freedom of the physical universe are not injected from outside but are \emph{released} by the synthesis of previously disconnected structure.

\begin{proposition}[Structural inflation precedes thermal inflation]
\label{prop:structural-inflation}
The combinatorial explosion at Step~15 ($\nu = 103$, compared to $\nu \leq 18$ at all prior steps) is a necessary precondition for any physical inflationary dynamics.
Inflation requires a scalar field propagating on a differentiable manifold with Lorentzian metric; all of these structures are in $\B_{14}$, but they acquire dynamical content only at Step~15.
The ``inflaton field'' is not a separate posit: it is the generic vector field $v : \U \to \U^{\D}$ whose existence is guaranteed by the DCT's corecursion principle.
\end{proposition}


% ============================================
% 5. THE ARROW OF TIME
% ============================================
\section{The Arrow of Time and Minimal Entropy}
\label{sec:arrow}

\subsection{The Causal Arrow from Guardedness}
\label{sec:causal-arrow}

Why does time flow in one direction?
In thermodynamic accounts, the arrow of time is derived from the second law and the assumption of a low-entropy initial condition---but this merely pushes the question back to why the initial condition was special.
In PEN, the arrow of time is not a thermodynamic consequence but a \emph{type-theoretic primitive}: it is built into the logical structure of the $\nextmod$ operator.

The guardedness condition in L\"ob's rule~\eqref{eq:lob} is asymmetric by construction: a term of type $\nextmod A \to A$ can use tomorrow's value to compute today's value, but there is no dual rule $A \to \nextmod A$ that would allow today's value to determine tomorrow's independently of the dynamical law.
More precisely, the only way to produce a term of type $\nextmod A$ is by applying a dynamical system $f : A \to \nextmod A$ to a current state; one cannot extract a future state except by running the system forward.

\begin{theorem}[Type-theoretic irreversibility]
\label{thm:irreversibility}
In the DCT, the guarded corecursion principle $\fix : (\nextmod A \to A) \to A$ is not invertible: there is no general term of type $A \to (\nextmod A \to A)$ that recovers the generating function from its fixpoint.
Consequently, the temporal unfolding $\unfold_f : X \to \Stream\, X$ is causally one-directional: given a stream, one can extract any finite prefix by iterated application of $\nextmod$, but one cannot in general recover the state at tick $n$ from the state at tick $n + k$ for $k > 0$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
Suppose for contradiction that a general inverse $\fix^{-1} : A \to (\nextmod A \to A)$ existed.
Then for any type $A$, one could construct a term of type $\nextmod A \to A$ from any element of $A$, which when fed back into $\fix$ would yield a fixpoint independent of the dynamical law $f$.
This violates the productivity guarantee of guarded corecursion: the $\nextmod$ guard ensures that each step of the unfolding makes genuine computational progress.
A general inverse would collapse the guarded modality, making $\nextmod A \simeq A$, which contradicts the non-triviality of temporal logic in the DCT (the Compatibility Triad requires $\nextmod$ to be distinguishable from the identity).
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Closed timelike curves are ill-typed]
\label{rem:ctc}
A closed timelike curve (CTC) in General Relativity is a worldline that returns to its own past.
In the DCT, a CTC would require a term of type $\Stream\, X \to X$ that extracts a state and feeds it back as the input to its own causal past---a circular dependency of the form $x = f(\nextmod x)$ without the L\"ob guard.
Such a term is \emph{ill-typed} in the guarded fragment: the type-checker rejects it because the $\nextmod$ delay cannot be discharged without forward progress.
CTCs are not physically impossible for contingent dynamical reasons; they are logically excluded by the universe's native type system.
\end{remark}

\subsection{The Past Hypothesis as Algorithmic Compression}
\label{sec:past-hypothesis}

The ``Past Hypothesis''---the empirical observation that the universe began in a state of extraordinarily low entropy~\cite{penrose-road,carroll}---is one of the deepest unexplained facts in physics.
Statistical mechanics can explain why entropy increases \emph{given} a low-entropy initial state, but it cannot explain why the initial state was special.
The low-entropy boundary condition is typically imposed by hand as a cosmological axiom.

PEN provides a constructive explanation.
The $t = 0$ state---the state of the universe at the moment of runtime ignition---is not an arbitrary initial condition.
It is the \emph{output} of 15~steps of strict efficiency maximization under Kolmogorov-complexity-minimal specification.

\begin{theorem}[Minimal algorithmic entropy at $t = 0$]
\label{thm:past-hypothesis}
The physical state at the onset of dynamics ($t = 0$) is specified by the complete DCT library $\B_{15}$, whose total specification complexity is $\kappa_{\mathrm{total}} = \sum_{i=1}^{15} \kappa_i = 92$ clauses (equivalently, 610~bits in MBTT encoding~\cite{pen}).
This is the shortest description consistent with the full kinematic framework.
Any reordering or alternative branch of the Generative Sequence that produces equivalent kinematic capacity requires equal or greater total $\kappa$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
The selection dynamics at each step chooses the candidate with minimal overshoot (Axiom~4 of~\cite{pen}), which jointly minimizes $\kappa$ subject to the bar-clearing constraint (ties broken by minimal $\kappa$).
The result is a constructive proof that the 15-step trajectory is Kolmogorov-optimal among trajectories producing equivalent kinematic content: any alternative path that arrives at the same library must match or exceed the total specification cost, because each step is locally minimal in $\kappa$ among bar-clearing candidates.
\end{proof}

The physical consequence is direct: the $t = 0$ state inherits the algorithmic compressibility of the Generative Sequence.
A state that can be specified in 610~bits admits essentially no combinatorial disorder.
It is a state of maximal algorithmic compression---which is the information-theoretic definition of minimal entropy.

\begin{remark}[From algorithmic compression to thermodynamic entropy]
\label{rem:entropy}
The connection between Kolmogorov complexity and thermodynamic entropy is well-established in algorithmic information theory~\cite{zurek-complexity}: a microstate's thermodynamic entropy is bounded below by its algorithmic complexity.
A system whose complete specification requires only 610~bits occupies a region of phase space so small that its Boltzmann entropy $S = k_B \ln W$ is negligible.
The Past Hypothesis is therefore not a mysterious fine-tuning of initial conditions but the \emph{inevitable} consequence of the universe's kinematic framework having been generated by an efficiency-maximizing compression process.
\end{remark}


% ============================================
% 6. THE UNIVALENT HORIZON AS COSMOLOGICAL FIREWALL
% ============================================
\section{The Univalent Horizon as the Cosmological Firewall}
\label{sec:firewall}

\subsection{Resolving the Halting Problem: Structural Termination}
\label{sec:termination}

The PEN Generative Sequence does not ``die'' at Step~15.
It halts---in the precise sense of Theorem~5.12 of~\cite{pen}---because the external generator is rendered obsolete.

The argument has three steps:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item The DCT internalizes its own evolutionary mechanism as a geometric flow on $\U$ (Lemma~5.11 of~\cite{pen}).
    The metamathematical process of ``searching for the next type'' is representable as a vector field $v : \U \to \U^{\D}$, unfolded into a trajectory by guarded corecursion.
    \item By univalence, paths in $\U$ are type equivalences: $(A =_{\U} B) \simeq (A \simeq B)$.
    Integrating the vector field produces a continuous family of types connected by paths in $\U$, hence a family of pairwise equivalent types.
    The flow is permanently confined to the connected component of $\U$ containing $\B_{15}$.
    \item Any candidate $Y$ proposed at Step~16 is either (a)~internally derivable (contributing $\nu = 0$) or (b)~structurally alien to the $d = 2$ Coherence Window (incurring $\Delta_{16} = F_{16} = 987$ integration latency, making $\rho \ll \mathrm{Bar}_{16} \approx 9.08$).
    In either case, the bar is permanently uncleared.
\end{enumerate}

The universe does not stop evolving at Step~15; it stops \emph{needing external structural input} at Step~15.
The distinction is between a system that cannot continue (failure) and a system that has achieved self-sufficiency (closure).
The Generative Sequence halts because the DCT is a fixpoint of the selection dynamics, not because the dynamics has run out of candidates.

\subsection{Epistemic Isolation: The Cosmological Microwave Background Analogy}
\label{sec:epistemic}

The Big Bang is opaque to physical observation: electromagnetic radiation from before the epoch of recombination ($t \approx 380{,}000$ years) is thermalized into the Cosmic Microwave Background~\cite{penzias-wilson}, and no photon signal penetrates earlier.
PEN provides a structural analogue of this observational horizon that is deeper than thermalization.

\begin{proposition}[Epistemic isolation of the compilation epoch]
\label{prop:epistemic}
Internal observers---agents whose perceptual and computational apparatus is itself a structure within $\B_{15}$---cannot construct an observable that probes the discrete algorithmic steps (1--14) that built the topos.
The pre-Bang compilation epoch is accessible only via type-theoretic deduction, not physical measurement.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
An ``observation'' in the DCT is a continuous geometric flow: a section of some bundle, a functional on a Hilbert space, or a path in a moduli space.
All such flows are terms in the internal language of the DCT, and by the Univalent Horizon (Theorem~5.12 of~\cite{pen}), they are confined to the connected component of $\U$ containing $\B_{15}$.
The discrete algorithmic steps $\tau_1, \ldots, \tau_{14}$ are \emph{not} connected to $\B_{15}$ by paths in $\U$---they belong to the external metatheory, not the internal geometry.
Any attempt to construct a physical observable that ``sees'' the compilation epoch would require a path crossing the Univalent Horizon, which is precisely what the horizon forbids.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[The CMB as a physical shadow of the Univalent Horizon]
\label{rem:cmb}
The Cosmic Microwave Background is the earliest physical signal accessible to electromagnetic observation.
In PEN, it is a \emph{physical consequence} of the same structural boundary that the Univalent Horizon enforces type-theoretically.
The opacity is not accidental---it is the observable signature of the fact that physical measurement (continuous geometric flow) cannot reach the discrete compilation epoch.
The CMB is, in this sense, a thermal echo of the phase transition from algorithmic time $\tau$ to physical time $t$.
\end{remark}

% 7. CONCLUSION
% ============================================
\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The standard approach to cosmogenesis looks for a physical, kinetic mechanism that \emph{triggered} the Big Bang---a quantum fluctuation, a tunneling event, a collision of branes.
Each such proposal presupposes the very structures (quantum fields, spacetime, dynamics) whose origin it is supposed to explain.

PEN inverts the explanatory order.
The Big Bang is not an event that happened within physics; it is the mathematically necessary boundary at which physics \emph{begins}.
Specifically:

\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{The compilation epoch} (Steps~1--14) assembles the kinematic framework---types, spaces, cohesion, metrics, Hilbert functionals---in discrete algorithmic time $\tau$, without presupposing continuous dynamics.
    \item \textbf{Runtime ignition} (Step~15) introduces the DCT, whose Kinematic-Dynamic Equivalence ($\nextmod X \simeq X^{\D}$) geometrizes time, converting discrete temporal logic into continuous infinitesimal structure.
    L\"ob's guarded corecursion sets the static library into perpetual, autonomous motion.
    \item \textbf{The inflationary epoch} is the combinatorial schema explosion ($\nu = 103$) produced by the sudden cross-interaction of 14~previously disconnected kinematic structures.
    \item \textbf{The arrow of time} is the type-theoretic asymmetry of the guarded $\nextmod$ modality: forward computation is productive, backward extraction is ill-typed.
    \item \textbf{The Past Hypothesis} is the algorithmic compressibility of the Generative Sequence: a universe built by 15~steps of Kolmogorov-optimal selection begins in a state of minimal entropy by construction.
    \item \textbf{The Univalent Horizon} is the cosmological firewall separating the pre-physical compilation epoch from the self-computing physical runtime.
    The pre-Bang universe is epistemically isolated from internal observers, accessible only through the type-theoretic deduction that PEN provides.

The physical universe is the runtime execution of the Dynamical Cohesive Topos.
We must stop looking for a first cause within physics and instead recognize the Big Bang as the halting condition of the universe's foundational compilation phase---the moment at which the formal system achieves self-sufficiency and begins computing its own future.
