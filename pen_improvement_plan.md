# PEN Paper Improvement Plan for Peer-Review Hardening

## Goal
Produce a revision package for `pen_unified.tex` that closes the major reviewer attack surfaces (A–F), while preserving the core scientific objective: discovering the canonical sequence from explicit, auditable rules rather than protecting a pre-fixed table.

## Global policy updates (latest)
1. **Strict accounting canon (Workstream A):** scalar dependencies are now evaluated under **V1 strict first-use full-charge**; amortized/off-ledger treatment is not normative.
2. **Step-13 bar normalization:** use **5.99** as the operative Step-13 bar in all planning and sensitivity artifacts.
3. **Rescue mechanism constraint:** if Step 13 fails under V1, recovery must come from **mechanically computed** novelty (`\Delta\nu`), not accounting conventions.
4. **Table is provisional:** structure order and `(\nu,\kappa)` entries may be revised if math/logic/engine evidence demands it.

## Workstream A — Scalar Provenance (`\mathbb{R}`) under Strict V1

### Current status snapshot
- A1 complete: primary route locked to Cauchy completion.
- A2 complete: minimal REQ scalar dependency bundle identified.
- A3 revised: strict V1 first-use full-charge is canonical.
- A4 revised: baseline Step 13 fails under V1 unless additional mechanically-derived novelty is counted.

### Core problem statement (updated)
Step 13 currently uses `g : TX \otimes_s TX \to \R`. Under strict V1 charging, adding scalar-construction cost increases `\kappa` immediately; with baseline `\nu_{13}=46`, this generally drops `\rho` below bar 5.99 unless sufficient interaction novelty is discovered.

### Path A operational alternatives (updated)

#### Path A-C+V3 (strict Cauchy + mechanical novelty)
Keep Cauchy tower, but run uniform/typed novelty computation on the combined library to obtain genuine `\Delta\nu` from scalar–geometry–cohesion interactions.
- Requirement: `\Delta\nu` must be engine-derived, reproducible, and queryable from AST/type traces.
- Acceptance test: show `\nu_{13}^{\text{new}}/(7+\kappa_{\mathrm{scalar}}) > 5.99`.

#### Path A-Topo (topological arithmetic compression)
Attempt to reduce scalar `\kappa` burden by deriving integer/rational scaffolding from already-selected topology (e.g., loop-space/fundamental-group style constructions where applicable in current formal setting).
- Requirement: explicit derivation artifacts and reduced clause burden accounting.
- Acceptance test: lower `\kappa_{\mathrm{scalar}}` enough that required `\Delta\nu` is materially reduced.

#### Path A-S (synthetic continuum insertion)
Treat smooth line/continuum object as explicit cohesive primitive at a prior step (e.g., 12.5), then Metric references it.
- Requirement: explicit clause cost at insertion step and full sequence recomputation.
- Acceptance test: sequence remains coherent under strict first-use charging and selected ordering is revalidated.

### Concrete `pen_unified.tex` edits for Workstream A
1. Add a scalar provenance policy paragraph in assumptions/foundations: no free scalar imports.
2. Standardize Step-13 bar references to 5.99.
3. In Step 13, explicitly state current route (Cauchy, topological compression, or synthetic insertion) and how cost is charged.
4. Add a dedicated sensitivity subsection/table:
   - baseline,
   - V1 full-charge,
   - V3 mechanical-rescue results,
   - optional alternative-route run(s).
5. Clarify that if strict V1 fails for a route, sequence/order may change (research mode), and that this is a result, not an error.

### Workstream A deliverables (revised)
- A single “Scalar Provenance and Cost” appendix section with:
  - chosen scalar route,
  - dependency DAG,
  - explicit `\kappa_{\mathrm{scalar}}`,
  - measured/derived `\Delta\nu` evidence,
  - bar comparison against 5.99.
- Updated table rows if route/ordering changes are required.

### Workstream A acceptance criteria (revised)
1. No unresolved `\R` origin anywhere in manuscript.
2. Strict V1 full-charge calculation is shown explicitly.
3. If Step 13 is retained, bar crossing is demonstrated mechanically (not by policy).
4. If Step 13 is not retained, revised sequence is documented with reproducible evidence.
5. All Step-13 bar references are 5.99-consistent.

## Workstream B — Search Space Transparency (Autonomy)
1. Add explicit pipeline narrative (typed generation → pruning → canonicalization → scoring).
2. Report stage counts from run artifacts.
3. Clarify what is grammar-engineered vs what is algorithmically selected.

**Deliverable:** table of candidate counts by stage + reproducibility command references.

---

## Workstream C — API Bundling Fairness (`\N` vs geometry)
1. Add steel-man arithmetic bundle analysis.
2. Show that even with generous discrete API assumptions, topology bottleneck (`\nu_H=0`) remains limiting.
3. Keep the argument symmetric with metric bundling logic.

**Deliverable:** mini comparative table (`\N` minimal, `\N` steel-man, metric/scalar route variant).

---

## Workstream D — Semantic Pareidolia Defense
1. Move “structural analogy vs physical law” disclaimer into main text.
2. Annotate AST-facing tables with semantic-level tags.
3. Prevent over-claims that unconstrained signatures imply full physical equations.

**Deliverable:** updated main-text disclaimer + annotated table column.

---

## Workstream E — Maximal Interface Density as metatheoretic necessity
1. Reframe as normalization/canonicity requirement, not style policy.
2. Add stuck-term counterexample sketch when interaction clauses are omitted.
3. Keep physics analogy secondary.

**Deliverable:** proposition-style justification + short proof sketch.

---

## Workstream F — MBTT Grammar Teleology
1. Explain modalities as primitive expressivity choices, not preordained targets.
2. Add ablation/comparison statement where feasible.
3. Show non-selected alternatives from same grammar.

**Deliverable:** grammar rationale paragraph + optional ablation note/table.

---

## Cross-cutting execution phases (updated)

### Phase 1 — Policy and consistency lock
- Freeze strict V1 + bar 5.99 conventions in manuscript and notes.
- Remove stale references to amortized normativity.

### Phase 2 — Quantitative reruns
- Run V1 baseline and V3 mechanical-rescue computations.
- If pursuing A-Topo or A-S, run corresponding route variants.

### Phase 3 — Manuscript integration
- Apply Workstream A edits first, then B–F.
- Update all tables/claims that depend on changed sequence/order.

### Phase 4 — Final audit
- Verify all `\R` references, bars, and accounting formulas are consistent.
- Confirm every major claim is tied to explicit data/proof/caveat.

---

## Immediate next actions
1. Implement mechanical V3 novelty run (combined Metric + scalar bundle) and extract `\Delta\nu` trace evidence.
2. Decide whether Cauchy route is salvageable under strict V1, or pivot to A-Topo/A-S.
3. Only then freeze revised Step 13 (or sequence revision) in `pen_unified.tex`.
